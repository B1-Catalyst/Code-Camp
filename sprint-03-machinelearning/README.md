## Steps to Get Started
[IMPORTANT: Follow this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com)
1. [Get a Free Trial Account on SAP Cloud Platform](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)
2. [Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html)
3. [Install the Machine Learning foundation plugin for SAP Cloud Platform CLI](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mlf-install-sapmlcli.html)
4. [Create a Machine Learning Foundation service instance on the Cloud Foundry environment](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mlf-create-instance.html)
5. [Prepare your environment for retraining](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mlf-retrain-image-classification-01.html)
6. Prepare the customer profile images dataset.
7. Extract the face feature of each customer profile image and store into to a vector text file
8. Upload the feature vector file to your MLF instance bucket
9. Retrain your own Customizable Similarity Search with MLF
10. Deploy your retrained Similarity Search model
11. Put together the face feature extraction, your retrained nns model and default similarity scoring into a Face ID API (RESTful API - Input: image, output: customer id, name).
12. Bonus exercise: Integrate your FaceID api with SAP Business One and SAP ByD with small app (fiori or mobile) to take a photo of customer, then recognise the customer with your FaceID api, and show its customer no, name, balance etc.
